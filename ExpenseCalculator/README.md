# ExpenseCalculator
The application is used to record expenses and income. The program allows you to create categories and assign amounts and dates to them. You can enter a note for each transaction. On the charts, we can see our transactions from the last month and check the balance, total expenses and income. I use C# Entity Framework LINQ HTML CSS Bootstrap SQL FusionCharts GridMvcCore.
